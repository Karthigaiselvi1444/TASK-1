# Customer Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview

This data science project aims to analyze customer behavior based on transaction data. The goal is to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns, preferences, and trends. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to extract meaningful information from the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamprateek/store-transaction-data). It contains transactional data from multiple retail stores, including details such as product details and purchase amount. The dataset provides a rich source of information for understanding customer behavior and making data-driven business decisions.

### Dataset Structure

- `month`: Unique identifier for each month.
- `storecode`: Unique identifier for each store.
- `bill_amount`: The amount spent by the customer on a particular transaction.
- `bill_date`: Unique identifier for each bill.

## Code Overview

### Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are utilized to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring that it is ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify patterns, outliers, and trends. Descriptive statistics, data summarization, and 

## Visualizations

visualizations are used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the customer behavior captured in the dataset.The repository includes various visualizations created using seaborn, matplotlib and plotly to create charts, graphs, and plots that highlight key insights derived from the data.

## Conclusion

By leveraging data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior based on transactional data. The findings can be used for strategic business decisions, personalized marketing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction.

#Climate_Data_Analysis
Overview
This data analysis project focuses on analyzing climate data to gain insights into temperature patterns, precipitation trends, and other climatic factors. The goal is to explore historical climate data, identify patterns, and provide valuable information for understanding climate change and its potential impacts.

##Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from here. It contains historical climate data, including temperature, precipitation, and other relevant variables. The dataset spans multiple years and covers various geographical locations, providing a comprehensive view of climatic conditions.

##Code Overview
Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, checking for outliers, and ensuring data consistency. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are utilized to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring that it is ready for analysis.

##Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand the distribution of temperature, precipitation patterns, and potential correlations with time. Descriptive statistics and data summarization are used to identify trends and anomalies in the climate data.

##Visualizations
Various visualizations, including line charts, heatmaps, and geographical plots, are created using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These visualizations help convey insights into temperature variations, precipitation trends, and geographical patterns over time.

##Conclusion
By leveraging data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into historical climate data. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of climate patterns, aid in climate change research, and support informed decision-making for environmental policies and initiatives.
